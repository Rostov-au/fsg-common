"""The section library's write guard: a check cannot save you from a bad write.

Why this file exists
--------------------
`refresh_from_workbook.py --check` reported "up to date" immediately AFTER a
bad regeneration, and it was telling the truth. `--check` is a **consistency**
check -- "does the committed copy match what I would generate now" -- so when
both sides are bad they agree and it says so. It is not broken and it is not
lying; it answers a different question from the one people read it as.

Demonstrated by construction (wt-parallel-f6, 1 Sep 2026), an openpyxl
round-trip of the workbook against the Excel-written original:

    GOOD  733 sections,  77 masses None (10%),  310UB40 = 40.4
    BAD   733 sections, 730 masses None (99%),  310UB40 = None
    committed(bad) vs BAD  ->  UP TO DATE       <- the fail-open

**The section count is identical in both, so counting rows catches nothing** --
that is the obvious guard and it does not work. These tests pin the two that do,
and pin that the count does not.

**The first version of the guard had a fail-open of its own, closed by David on
1 Sep 2026.** It exempted the whole `PL` category from needing a mass, having
measured that every `PL` row in today's library is area-priced. His answer:
*"floor plate is priced by the m2 and other plate by the weight. There are
other types of plate that are also priced by m2 I cant remember them all."*
So a weight-priced plate row whose mass had been lost would have been waved
through -- the exact thing the guard exists to catch. The rule is now keyed on
the pricing BASIS rather than the category, which also means it does not need
the list of m2-priced plate types that nobody has.
