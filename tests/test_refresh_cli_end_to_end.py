"""`refresh_from_workbook.py` end to end, against real .xlsx files.

The unit tests either side of this one exercise `validation_failures` and
`provenance_refusals` as functions. That is not enough on its own: the accident
this guards against was a **command someone ran**, and every part of it lived
in `main()` -- which workbook got read, which committed copy got compared, and
whether anything was written. A guard that is correct as a function and unwired
in `main()` would pass every other test in this repo.

So these build actual workbooks with openpyxl, run `main()` against a temporary
data directory, and assert on the exit code and on the bytes on disk.

**The committed library is never the target.** `DATA_DIR` is monkeypatched to a
`tmp_path` in every test here; nothing in this file can write to
`src/fsg_common/sections/data/`.
