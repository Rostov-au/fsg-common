"""The twin-parity vocabulary, ported into the package that replaced the twins.

`fsg-tender-review/tests/test_resolver_twin_parity.py` compared its resolver
against the Bluebeam toolkit's copy on a shared vocabulary and failed on any
disagreement. That test exists because the two copies were found, on 26 Aug
2026, to disagree on seven notations, one of them a different mass.

Once both repos import this package there are no twins left to compare, so
the vocabulary changes job rather than retiring: every notation in it
resolves without raising, the cheapest broad regression net there is.

**The one notation the twins genuinely disagreed about is answered now, in
two steps.** `273 CHS 6.4` used to produce two different verdicts on
purpose, gated by a `RoundingPolicy` each consumer picked (`_policy.py`,
deleted 7 Sep 2026). fsg-tender-review#184 Q25 settled the verdict then --
both resolvers converge on `canonical` -- but the mass behind that verdict
was still the library's imperial 6.35 row, not the metric 6.40 one the
question actually asked about. David confirmed the mass directly on
18 Sep 2026 ("Confirm metric, 6.40"), and `_chs_metric_wall()` in
`_resolver.py` applies it. The policy split, `TENDER_REVIEW`/`BLUEBEAM`,
and the tests that pinned the disagreement are gone; the notation is now a
plain anchor in `vocabulary.ANCHORS` like any other answered question.

The live three-way comparison against both source repos is
`tools/parity_report.py`, which reads them at a pinned git ref. It is not a
test: it needs both sibling checkouts, which CI does not have.
