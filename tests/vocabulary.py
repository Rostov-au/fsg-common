"""The shared notation corpus. Used by the tests and by `tools/parity_report.py`.

Three layers, deliberately.

**1. VOCABULARY** is the twin-parity vocabulary, copied verbatim from
`fsg-tender-review/tests/test_resolver_twin_parity.py` at `origin/main`
(3 Sep 2026). Every entry earned its place by being a notation the two
resolvers were once found to disagree about, or one that a change to either
side was about to move. The comments are kept because they are the record of
why each was added.

**2. ANCHORS** are the load-bearing behaviours `fsg-tender-review/CLAUDE.md`
names in prose, paired with the rule each one pins. The vocabulary proves the
two implementations agree; the anchors prove the answer is the RIGHT one.
That distinction is not academic here. `10 SQ ROD` and `M30 THREADED ROD`
were both wrong in BOTH resolvers for months, agreeing the whole time,
because neither token had ever appeared in the vocabulary.

**3. `library_sweep()`** feeds every section id in the snapshot back in as a
notation. Rule 15 of `fsg-estimating-crm/docs/multi-session-working.md`: a
corpus only catches what it exercises, so hand-picked cases are paired with a
structural sweep nobody chose case by case. It is the layer that would catch
a change breaking a family no author thought to list.
