"""The compulsory reading path stays under 30,500 words -- crm#557, crm#635.

## What this is, and why it lives here rather than in five repos

David's decision on crm#557, 11 Sep 2026: cap the compulsory reading path --
one `CLAUDE.md` per FSG repo, plus (at the time) `fsg-tender-review/docs/
README.md`, which that repo's own `CLAUDE.md` named "Start here" -- the
words a session pays for on every single run, before any pointer sends it
anywhere else. Raised from 30,000 to 30,500 on crm#635, 18 Sep 2026.

**Narrowed, not raised again, 25 Sep 2026 (crm#1009).** Headroom fell to
about fifteen words twice in three days -- 30,495/30,500 on 23 Sep, then
30,490/30,500 on 24 Sep -- each time from one lane's ordinary edit to a
`CLAUDE.md` landing in an unrelated repo's PR. David considered raising the
limit again and running another trim pass, and rejected both: "narrow what
counts as compulsory" instead. `fsg-tender-review/docs/README.md` is removed
from `FILES` here. It earned the "Start here" label on 11 Sep, but that
repo's own `CLAUDE.md` has since restated its role as the map, read "before
touching a module you have not touched before" -- on demand, once a pointer
names it, not a page every session pays for regardless of what it touches.
The gate had not caught up to that restatement. The file itself is
untouched, still linked from `CLAUDE.md`'s "Where things live", still the
map -- only this word-cap gate stops counting it.

This check first shipped as a 300-line script duplicated inside
`fsg-estimating-crm` alone (`scripts/check_reading_path_word_count.py`,
12 Sep 2026), running only in that repo's CI. On 19 Sep 2026 a doc edit in
`fsg-tender-review` pushed the shared total over the cap and turned two
unrelated `fsg-estimating-crm` PRs red -- the repo that broke was the one
that did not change, because nothing but crm's own CI ever re-measured the
total. David's decision then: run the identical check in all five repos'
own CI, pre-merge, so each one catches its own overage before it ships.

Five copies of this logic is exactly the failure this estate has already
paid for twice -- `check_twin_parity.py` (deleted, tr#281/5 Sep 2026
adoption) and the `fsg_sections.json` twin (retired, fsg-common#6/#12, 7 Sep
2026) both existed because a resolver was copied into more than one repo and
drifted. `fsg_common` is the shared package all four consumers already
import or vendor for exactly that reason, so the check lives here once and
each repo carries only a thin CLI wrapper that names which repo it is
running in and calls `main()`.

## Parameterisation: `this_repo`, not a module constant

The original script hardcoded `THIS_REPO = "fsg-estimating-crm"` and read
that one repo's file from the local working tree (never the API -- a PR
that edits a repo's own `CLAUDE.md` is judged on the content it proposes,
not on an API call that would still return the pre-PR body). Five repos
need five different answers to "which file(s) are mine", so `this_repo` is
a parameter here, supplied by each repo's own wrapper script -- a single
short string, not something derived by inspecting `__file__`, because once
this module is installed or vendored into a consumer, `__file__` resolves
inside THIS package, not the consumer's checkout. `repo_root` is the same
kind of parameter, defaulting to `os.getcwd()`, which is correct both in a
CI step (actions/checkout leaves you at the repo root) and for a person
running the wrapper from their own checkout.

A repo CAN own more than one local file -- `main()` reads every `FILES`
entry whose repo matches `this_repo` from disk, and everything else over
the GitHub API. No repo currently does (fsg-tender-review was the one
example, until `docs/README.md` was removed from `FILES` on 25 Sep 2026,
crm#1009); the capability stays because a repo splitting its compulsory
rules across two files is a legitimate shape this module should not
special-case away.

## Credential

Same pattern `scripts/vendor_fsg_common.py` and
`fsg-tender-review/scripts/check_fsg_common_pins.py` already use for this
exact problem: `FSG_COMMON_PAT` first (David's classic PAT, `repo` scope),
then `GH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Three of the four files this module
reads over the API live in private repos; a workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` is
scoped to its own repository and cannot read them. **Absent input must not
answer**: no credential is a REFUSAL (exit 2), never a total that silently
omitted four of five files. A repo whose CI has no `FSG_COMMON_PAT` secret
refuses every run until one is added -- that is this module working, not a
bug to route around.

## The one exemption: a Dependabot-actor pull_request run

fsg-tender-review#639, 18 Sep 2026: GitHub withholds every repository secret
from a `pull_request` run whose actor is `dependabot[bot]` -- confirmed a
maintainer's own re-run of that same run still saw the secret empty; only a
genuinely NEW event restores it. `dependabot_actor()` is true only for the
exact platform-imposed case; even then the skip is not taken on trust --
`local_file_touched_since()` runs a local, tokenless `git diff` to confirm
this run's own diff did not touch any of THIS repo's own local files, and
refuses (never skips) if that cannot be established.

## Word count method

`len(text.split())` -- the same definition POSIX `wc -w` uses with a
correctly configured locale. Measured 12 Sep 2026: a plain `wc -w` in an
unconfigured shell locale mis-splits a multi-byte UTF-8 em dash and
undercounts by about 3% against `str.split()`; this module uses
`str.split()` deliberately so the answer does not depend on the caller's
shell locale. No markdown stripping -- a table cell or a code fence is still
text a session's context window pays for.
