"""Resolve a drawing's own section notation to FSG's canonical library.

## One resolver, two consumers

This module is the single copy. It replaces two hand-maintained twins that
were held together by a hook, a parity test and a baseline script:

- `fsg-tender-review/src/fsg_tender_review/resolve.py` (848 lines)
- `fsg-bluebeam-steel-standards/tools/fsg_mto/sections.py` (878 lines)

The body below is a near-verbatim copy of the first of those, which was
itself a near-verbatim port of the second. Nothing was rewritten in the
move: the port is nine exact-string edits, listed in `docs/port.md`, and
`diff` against the source shows those and nothing else. Every guard clause
here exists because a first version got a real number wrong -- `200 x 200 x
10 PL` resolving to `200PL` at 1570 kg/m2 instead of `10PL` at 78.5 (20x
over, labelled `canonical` so nothing flagged it); `C1 100 x 100 x 5 SHS`
resolving to `1SHS5`; `ALUMINIUM 100 x 50 x 3 RHS` priced as steel (2.9x
over). A reimplementation would rediscover those one at a time, on real
tenders.

## The one thing the two twins did not agree on

They agreed on 834 of 835 notations when measured on 3 Sep 2026
(`tools/parity_report.py`). The exception is a CHS wall written one decimal
short -- `273 CHS 6.4` against the library's `273CHS6.35` -- which
tender-review calls `canonical` and the Bluebeam toolkit calls `nearest`.
Same section, same mass, different verdict, so it changes whether an
estimator is asked to look.

That is an open question for FSG's estimators, not a defect
(Rostov-au/fsg-tender-review#184 item 1), and this package does not settle
it. `_policy.RoundingPolicy` carries it, so each consumer keeps the answer
it has today. Delete the policy when the question is answered.

## Report how, always

`(Section, how)` out, never a bare mass -- `exact` (the drawing already
wrote the library's own ID), `canonical` (rewritten into library form, or a
rounding of the library's own AS/NZS mass), `nearest` (closest same-depth
section; needs an estimator's eye), `cold-formed` (a real C/Z purlin code
`90_Lists` does not carry -- a library gap, not a misread), `unresolved`,
`material-mismatch` (aluminium/stainless/timber -- refuses rather than
pricing it as steel), `shape-modifier` (THREADED/HEX: a cross-section
90_Lists has no family for -- refuses rather than dropping the word and
pricing the plain shape), or `substitution` (an estimator's recorded
decision, never a resolver guess). A caller that hides *how* behind a bare
mass is the exact failure fsg-tender-review's "masses never come from you"
rule exists to prevent, just moved one step downstream.

# never meet; see the field note below): the corpus that actually exists
# there is the GLUED-L shape -- 51 occurrences, 25 distinct leg/leg/

# ('aa - L45x45x5') -- not the fully bare one, which barely occurs as its
# own isolated string once real drawing text is accounted for (an earlier
# draft of this comment measured "bare, no L anywhere" and found the real
# population was glued-L instead; corrected before this shipped, not
# after). Both shapes are covered here since neither is riskier than the
# other once `L`/type-word detection has already ruled out everything else.
#
# Of the 25 distinct combinations measured, 17 are non-standard thicknesses
# or plainly garbled and correctly resolve to nothing today.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, found the same night measuring the above: nearly
# every one of these 51 legend entries is itself a short embedded string
# ('aa - L45x45x5', not 'L45x45x5'), and `resolve()` anchors to the WHOLE
# string. Checked directly against all 292 `dimensions` entries anywhere in
# FSG-25Q-319 whose embedded notation names one of that job's 15 priced
# sections (a larger population than the 51 above -- it also includes the
# job's separate schedule-row `dimensions`, e.g. '1130 2 EA 70 x 70 x 5
# 1809 9.8 9.8 345 T201/6/13/180'): only 1 of 292 resolves on the full

# answer to, and the honest outcome is a refusal that says why -- exactly as

    wide, 6000 long, and the group minimum read it as 100PL -- ten to twenty
    times the mass, labelled canonical. A number written against the PL
    token and OUTSIDE the dimension group is the thickness the same way a
    THK callout is. Only outside: in `200 x 200 x 10 PL` the adjacent 10 is
    the group's own last member, and the minimum rule answers it unchanged.

          answer to fsg-tender-review#184 Q27, 7 Sep 2026: Stramit and

          depth/BMT, not merely close on mass. Unlike the bare alias below,
          the manufacturer IS what the drawing wrote; only the specific row
          moved. Exact alias only, refusing to ``cold-formed`` on a miss

          prefix) aliased to its Lysaght row -- David's decision, 5 Sep 2026
          (tr#280): the only maker currently in the library, so a bare code
          is assumed to mean that one, but the manufacturer is an
          ASSUMPTION the drawing did not state and callers must surface it
          as one, not as a fact. Exact alias only, refusing to
          ``cold-formed`` on a miss -- never `nearest` (see `resolve()`'s
          own comment at the alias check for the measured reason: a bare
          library row would let genuinely different BMTs match each other
          as `nearest`, a 62% mass error reported as a plausible verdict)
        - ``cold-formed``    a readable C/Z purlin code, bare or vendor-
          prefixed, that 90_Lists does not carry even under the assumed
          manufacturer -- a library gap, not a bad read
        - ``material-mismatch``  aluminium/stainless/timber/etc. -- refuses
          rather than pricing it as steel
        - ``shape-modifier`` the notation names a cross-section 90_Lists has
          no family for (THREADED, HEX) -- refuses rather than dropping the
          word and pricing the plain shape. `shape_modifier()` says which
          word it was; `shape_modifier_candidates()` names the plain section
          it declined to assert, so the miss is settleable
        - ``substitution``   a genuine library gap the drawing states, priced
          as a *different* real size because an estimator decided to, for
          this specific size (`substitutions.py`) -- never a resolver guess
        - ``unresolved``     no safe match
