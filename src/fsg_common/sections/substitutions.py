"""Estimator-authored notation substitutions -- a size a drawing states that
`90_Lists` genuinely does not carry, which an estimator has decided to price
as a *different*, real library size.

## Why this exists, and why it is not a resolver rule

`114.3 CHS x 4.8mm` is not a standard size; FSG buys `114.3 CHS x 4.5mm`
instead. `resolve.py` will never guess that on its own -- a resolver that
silently substitutes one wall thickness for another the moment it can't find
an exact match is exactly the kind of guess `CLAUDE.md` forbids, and it would
turn every future genuine miss into a plausible-looking wrong number instead
of an honest "not carried". The substitution is a business decision an
estimator made for *this specific size*, not a pattern `resolve.py` could
safely generalise (a `+0.3mm` rule would misprice the next size that really
is missing).

So this stays a **named, dated, attributed list** an estimator owns
(`data/substitutions.json`) -- the same shape as the workbook's other
operator-authored files -- and `resolve.SectionLibrary.resolve()` consults it
only after every other path (exact, canonical, nearest, cold-formed) has
already failed to find the real, drawn-as-stated section. A hit is reported
as `how="substitution"`, never folded into `"exact"`/`"canonical"`: the
drawing still said 4.8mm, and every caller downstream (`pagedata.py`'s
findings register, `workbook_export.py`'s Notes column) must go on saying so.

## Adding an entry

Edit `data/substitutions.json` directly -- `from`/`to` are section notations
(matched via `resolve.loose_key`, so spacing/case/separators don't matter;
`to` must be a real, existing library `Section_ID`), plus `reason`,
`decided_by`, `date` (ISO), and `source` (where the decision is recorded, for
an audit trail back to the actual estimator answer). One entry so far --
28 Aug 2026, Q4 of `fsg-estimating-tools/docs/questions-for-estimators.md`.
