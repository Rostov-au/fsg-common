"""Regenerate the packaged copy of the FSG section library and labour rates.

David's decision, 21 Aug 2026: duplicate `90_Lists` rather than import from
the workbook at run time. That keeps every consumer standalone and testable
with no S: drive, at the cost of the copy going stale -- so the generated
file carries the source path, the date it was taken and a content hash, and
`sections.staleness_warning()` surfaces the age.

    python scripts/refresh_from_workbook.py
    python scripts/refresh_from_workbook.py --workbook <path> --check

THE OUTPUT IS GENERATED. Never hand-edit
`src/fsg_common/sections/data/fsg_sections.json`; change `90_Lists` and
re-run this. `--check` re-reads the workbook and compares the content hash,
which is the only check that answers "does the copy still match" -- an age
threshold cannot, and a snapshot one day old has been 17 rows short.

`data_only=True` is not optional: the mass columns are formulas, and reading
them as text turns every mass into None silently.

**Read-only.** openpyxl must never write to the live workbook. This script
opens read_only=True and writes only into `src/fsg_common/sections/data/`.

ONE SNAPSHOT, ONE PLACE. This used to live in `fsg-tender-review`, writing
into that repo, and the Bluebeam toolkit read the file across a sibling
checkout. Both now read the copy this script generates inside the package,
so a consumer cannot answer from a snapshot vintage it did not choose --
**consolidated here 7 Sep 2026** (fsg-common#6/#12): fsg-tender-review's own
`data/fsg_sections.json` and `scripts/refresh_from_workbook.py` are retired,
and this is the only regenerator either consumer has left.

# Ported from fsg-tender-review's own copy of this script, 7 Sep 2026 (the
# data-twin consolidation, fsg-common#6/#12) -- this default moved there on
# 4 Sep, after this file was first split off on 5 Sep, so this package had
# fallen behind: it still pointed at S:, which was ALREADY known wrong (see
# the superseded comment tender-review carried and this one now carries
# too). Porting the fix rather than picking the older default is the point
# of "make fsg-common's script the only regenerator" -- consolidating onto a
# stale default would have reintroduced the bug the 4 Sep decision fixed.
#
# Corrected 31 Aug 2026, in the source this was ported from. That version
# read `S:\fsg-estimating-tools\templates\FSG_Estimating_Template.xlsx`,
# which does not exist and never has -- S:'s root holds APPS/Admin/
# Business-Dev/EDA/Estimating/LISTJOBS, no `fsg-estimating-tools`. That path
# is the *repo's* layout written as though it were the share's. So the drift
# check could only ever report "workbook not found", and the one number it
# exists to produce was never produced. The regeneration that did work must
# have been given --workbook explicitly.
#
# The live copy is the one the workbook tooling deploys to and backs up
# beside (FSG_Estimating_Template.xlsx.bak-<date>-pre-<change>).
#
# Superseded 4 Sep 2026 by David's decision to move the library's provenance
# from the S: copy to the tracked template in `fsg-estimating-tools`. The S:
# copy is no longer the source: it still carries the coating rates and the
# fictional CHS wall thicknesses the repo template had corrected, so
# regenerating from it would put them back.
#
# Leaving the default pointed at S: would have recreated the bug described
# above in the opposite direction -- a bare `--check` would compare the
# committed copy against a workbook it did not come from, refuse with
# PROVENANCE MISMATCH, and produce no drift number at all. The default has to
# follow the decision, or the drift check stops working the day it is made.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The write guard, added 1 Sep 2026.
#
# `--check` is a CONSISTENCY check, not a validity one: it asks "does the
# committed copy match what I would generate now". So after a bad regeneration
# both sides are bad, they agree, and it reports `up to date` **truthfully**.
# It is not broken and it is not lying -- it answers a different question from
# the one people read it as, and no amount of work on the check path can fix
# that. Only the writer can refuse to make both sides wrong together.
#
# Demonstrated by construction (wt-parallel-f6, 1 Sep 2026), an openpyxl
# round-trip of the workbook against the Excel-written original:
#
#     GOOD  733 sections,  77 masses None (10%),  310UB40 = 40.4
#     BAD   733 sections, 730 masses None (99%),  310UB40 = None
#     committed(bad) vs BAD  ->  UP TO DATE       <- the fail-open
#
# **The section count is identical in both, so counting rows catches nothing.**
# That is the obvious guard and it does not work.

# **A section must carry AT LEAST ONE pricing basis: a per-metre mass or a
# per-square-metre mass.** That is the guard, and it is deliberately not a rule
# about categories.
#
# **Corrected 1 Sep 2026 by David, and the correction closed a fail-open in the
# first version of this guard.** That version exempted the whole `PL` category
# from needing a mass, on the measured observation that every `PL` row in
# today's library is priced by area. His answer: *"floor plate is priced by the
# m2 and other plate by the weight. There are other types of plate that are
# also priced by m2 I cant remember them all."*
#
# So plate is **not** one basis, and the exemption was wrong in the direction
# that matters: a weight-priced plate row whose mass had been lost would have
# been waved through, because it sat in an exempted category. The whole point
# of this guard is to catch a lost mass.
#
# Keying on the basis rather than the category also means **the rule does not
# need the list of m2-priced plate types** -- which is as well, since nobody
# has it. Whatever a row is priced by, it must say so; a workbook whose
# formulas did not evaluate says neither, because BOTH columns are computed
# ('Mass/m (kg/m) - FINAL' is `=IF(F6="","",F6)` and 'Plate kg/m2' is a density
# product).
#
# Measured over the committed library, 733 rows:
#     per-metre only   656
#     per-m2 only       72   (39 PL + 33 BIS)
#     NEITHER            5   (CUSTOM1..CUSTOM5, placeholder rows)
#
# The five CUSTOM placeholders are the only legitimate no-basis rows, and they
# are allowed by NAME rather than by category, so a real section that lands in
# CUSTOM still has to carry a basis.
NO_BASIS_ALLOWED = {"CUSTOM1", "CUSTOM2", "CUSTOM3", "CUSTOM4", "CUSTOM5"}

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The provenance guard, added 2 Sep 2026 -- the OTHER half of the same accident.
#
# The guard above catches a workbook that did not READ cleanly. It does not
# catch a workbook that read perfectly and was simply the WRONG ONE, which is
# what actually happened on 1 Sep 2026: a bare invocation regenerated from the
# 20 Aug copy on the share, and every mass in it was a real number.
#
# Measured by construction on this branch, against the payload committed at
# `bd85cc2` (21 Aug) -- a stale but structurally perfect library:
#
#     validation_failures(stale)  ->  []          <- it would have been written
#     75PFC        6.65  (the corrected library carries 5.92)
#     125x75RHS6  17.92  (the corrected library carries 16.70)
#
# Both controls passed in the same run -- the mass-stripped payload was refused
# and the current committed library was accepted -- so the clean result on the
# stale payload is the guard's real answer, not a broken probe.
#
# Two facts about the accident, and each gets a rule:
#
#   1. The workbook read was NOT the one the committed copy came from. The two
#      `_provenance.source` values differed and nothing compared them --
#      including `--check`, whose `content_sha256` is computed over the body
#      only, so the source is not in the hash it compares.
#   2. The workbook read was OLDER than the committed copy.
#
# **What rule 2 can and cannot prove, stated rather than assumed.** An mtime
# EARLIER than the committed copy's `taken` date proves the workbook cannot
# contain anything decided since -- that direction is sound. An mtime LATER
# proves nothing at all: a copy onto the share stamps `now` regardless of what
# is inside it. So this refuses the staleness it can see and makes no freshness
# claim, which is why it is a guard and not a check.
